# Dots-and-Boxes-game
> This is a python program completed in course programming Y1.

* The players take turns adding a line between two adjacent dots horizontally or vertically.
* A player who adds the fourth line of a 1x1 box earns a point and takes another turn.
* The game ends when all the lines are added to the grid. The winner is the player with more points in the end.
* The game grid can be any size. The size is defined by the number of boxes (formed from the dots). For example, a 2x2 grid has 4 boxes and 9 dots.
